### Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: The project demonstrates the use of the DSP48A1 slice for performing multiplication, addition, subtraction, and accumulation.
- **Pipelining**: The design is optimized for high-speed operation by leveraging the pipelining capabilities of the DSP48A1 slice.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Parameters such as bit-widths, operation modes, and pipeline depth can be easily modified to suit different application requirements.

### Project Structure

- **/Source**: Contains the Verilog source files implementing the DSP48A1-based modules and the testbench file for simulating and verifying the functionality of the DSP modules also the run_me.do for automation.

- **/Constraints**: Contains the Constraint files for the Basys 3 Artix-7â„¢ FPGA, specifying timing.

- **/Netlist**: Contains the netlist file generated by vivado.
